=====================================

You can use Map Proxy and Map Server to make your own Maps. To implement Map Proxy and Map Server, you should understand how it works.

Map Proxy is used for load data in cache memory which is doesn't necessary to load data to server.

Map Server is used for load big data geospatial so we can't use map proxy to load that big data.
