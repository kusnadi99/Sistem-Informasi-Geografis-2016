Meet 1 Geographic Information System
=====================================

Human needs can't be denied and forced us to develop a technology to solve a problem. One of the example to develop an Information System which most very needed is Geographic Information System.

**Geographic Information System** is an Information System which explain about what is on the surface of the earth. The people who development technology very needed a data to identify by the location.

Geographic Information System expected to answer the question which is :
> - What is it in there, meaning when we want to know a object, we need a data from the object.
> - Where the location of the object to be observed.
> - How if the object changed.
> - Which data between one object and the another object which is related.
> - And the last is, what happened if the object will changed.

How Much Important the Geographic Information System?
-----------------------------------------------------

There are a few things we must know when we develop a Geographic Information System. Because Geographic Information System need a map to know where is the object where we must research, things must to learn is know what is longtitude and latitude. To know where is the object in map we must determine an coordinate, which the coordinate will show the locate where the object or place in map.

So, whatever is needed in development Geographic Information System?
Besides some basic science to read the map of the world, we must know that is a software we need to development Geographic Information System, which is :
> - QGIS
QGIS is one of the software to development Geographic Information System. QGIS it's also one of the software too many developer used because it's **Open Source**.
> - Natural Earth
As reported in Official Site Natural Earth, we can get the data we need to development Geographic Information System.
> - Open Street Map (OPM)
OPM is one of the powerful software, from the information we receipt, the truth is information we receipt from OPM which is geography data from all over the world. Even the data difficult to find.

Beisdes a software needed, Geographic Information System need a support hardware which is **GPS (Global Positioning System)** is a system to determine a place in the earth, with GPS we can know our location (suitable location the GPS).
